# reactReduxCapstone
On this project, I created a a Catalog of Pokemons, it have 2 pages, a main page listing all the pokemons (on this page you can filter by type and/or name). And a second page with details of each pokemon, showing some information and the evolution chain of that particular pokemon.

At the main page in order to not overload the screen, when 'All' is selected, only the first 50 will show up, loading more when the scrolling is close to the end of the page, creating a better user experience.
